# Flashcards

## Overview

This flashcard app "Flashcard-o-matic" is designed to create, view, and study flashcards.

### Functionality

Students can create decks, view the cards within, and initiate "studying"--flipping through the cards in the deck, reading the front of each card first then back.

Implementation is included to perform necessary management functions such as adding, editing, and removing cards/decks.
